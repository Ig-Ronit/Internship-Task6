Quick Sign App
Overview: The Quick Sign App is a simple web-based application that allows users to create and save digital signatures. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app offers an intuitive interface for users to draw their signatures on a canvas, customize the appearance with various color options, and adjust pen sizes.

Key Features:

Interactive Canvas:

Users can draw directly on a large canvas area (800x500 pixels), providing ample space for signature creation.
The canvas can be customized with a background color, making it easy for users to choose their preferred aesthetic.
Customizable Drawing Tools:

A color picker enables users to select the pen color for drawing.
Users can choose different pen sizes from a dropdown menu, allowing for precise control over their signature appearance.
Signature Management:

Users can clear the canvas to start over or save their signature as a PNG file.
The app utilizes local storage to save the user's signature, enabling easy retrieval for future use.
User-Friendly Interface:

The layout is structured using Bootstrap for responsive design, ensuring usability across different devices.
Clear labeling of controls (e.g., "Text Colour Picker," "Background," "Pen Size") enhances user experience and ease of use.
Technical Stack:

HTML/CSS: Structure and styling of the application.
JavaScript: Handling user interactions, drawing functionality on the canvas, and managing local storage for saving and retrieving signatures.
Bootstrap: For responsive and modern design elements.
Usage:
